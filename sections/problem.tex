\chapter{Problem Definition}
\label{problem}

The primary objective of this project is to implement a \textit{multi-purpose recommender framework} to overcome specific issues of recommender systems explained further in this section. The focus on \emph{framework} intends to emphasise an ecosystem which provides a distinctive tool kit to build multiple recommender systems, yet guarantees a simple integration. Insofar the focus of the project will be in the design of an alternative -- perhaps novel -- architecture rather than in the details of techniques and algorithms.

This section discusses the requirements of the project. The requirements \emph{interoperability}, \emph{abstraction} and \emph{ease of integration} will become measures on how successful the project is in overcoming those issues.



\section{Project Requirements}

\subsection{Multi-Purpose \& Interoperability}
\label{problem-multipurpose}

A \emph{multi-purpose} recommender system is able to cope with different data sources and techniques. Ideally this system is open and extendable for possible forthcoming, yet unknown requirements. It is not to be confused with hybrid recommender systems (see section \ref{bg-tech-hybrid}) which combine different systems into one.

Another requirement is the interoperability between recommender systems. \citet{manouselis07} differentiate between three criteria:

\begin{description}
    \item[Interoperability of the recommendation queries] which allows the same query to be reused. \citet{adomavicius05} go further and create a \emph{Recommendation Query Language (RQL)}. The use of an RQL would go beyond the scope of this project. Therefore I will limit this criterion to query parameters rather than the full query and rely on the recommender system to build the query based on these parameters. To give an example, the query parameters for figure \ref{fig:contentbased} would be the customer reference and the rated item (in this case the laptop).
    \item[Interoperability of the user and the domain models] which allows the exchange of models and other data among different recommender systems. In this project I will go a step further and allow direct access to persistence layers to all recommender techniques.
    \item[Interoperability of the recommendation results] which empowers recommender systems to reuse the results. This is in particular useful for hybrid recommender systems which feed the same query into different systems. Yet there is no use case in this project and therefore will not be covered.
\end{description}

\subsection{Abstraction}
\label{problem-abstraction}

This requirement suggests to separate a software or architecture into smaller components. In this section the process of abstraction is illustrated based on a tightly-coupled, example architecture. With every discussed problem the architecture will become one step closer to an abstracted architecture. 

\begin{description}

    \item[Complexity] Applications as well as recommender systems tend to be complex. If not separated, they both add to the overall complexity which makes change management very difficult, time consuming and expensive. Any change requires knowledge, testing and probably modifications on both systems. Figure \ref{fig:abstraction-complexity} shows a tightly coupled system whose one recommender system is getting replaced. The whole primary application as well as the database are affected.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,center]{problem/abstraction/complexity.pdf}
        \caption[Abstraction: Complexity]{Abstraction: Complexity -- when the recommender system is replaced or changed, all red components are affected.}
        \label{fig:abstraction-complexity}
    \end{figure}

    \item[Database Abstraction] Recommender systems directly using databases of the primary application are problematic as these systems are affected by any change in the database. Figure \ref{fig:abstraction-database} illustrates a semi-decoupled architecture where the recommender system is outside of the primary application, yet still uses its database. This gives a false impression of loose coupling. Teams working on the primary application might not be fully aware that their changes affect the recommender systems.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,center]{problem/abstraction/database.pdf}
        \caption{Abstraction: Missing Database Abstraction}
        \label{fig:abstraction-database}
    \end{figure}

    \item[Reusability] Tightly coupled components are difficult to reuse. Figure \ref{fig:abstraction-resuability} shows an architecture where other applications and even devices such as mobile can reuse the recommender systems.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,center]{problem/abstraction/reusability.pdf}
        \caption{Abstraction: Reusable Architecture}
        \label{fig:abstraction-resuability}
    \end{figure}

    \item[Dependancy] If a system needs to be replaced or modified, it can have more or less major implications to other systems depending on that system. Figure \ref{fig:abstraction-dependancy} shows a loosely coupled architecture where the recommender technique has been changed to demographic filtering. In contrary to figure \ref{fig:abstraction-complexity} the primary application is not entirely affected. However the replacement can still affect other systems if the communication between them included content-based filtering specific logic.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,center]{problem/abstraction/dependancy.pdf}
        \caption[Abstraction: Dependancy Issues]{Abstraction: Dependancy Issues -- when the recommender system is replaced all dependancies (red arrows and elements) might require changes as well.}
        \label{fig:abstraction-dependancy}
    \end{figure}

    \item[Encapsulation] Information hiding is the fundamental motivation for encapsulation. The more information and implementation is hidden, the looser the coupling becomes. Figure \ref{fig:abstraction-encapsulation} illustrates a recommender system framework which hides internal details and communicates with other components in a technique-independent manner. A change of a technique within the framework or an external application should not have any implications.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,center]{problem/abstraction/encapsulation.pdf}
        \caption[Abstraction: Encapsulation]{Abstraction: Encapsulation -- when the recommender system is replaced no other component is affected.}
        \label{fig:abstraction-encapsulation}
    \end{figure}
\end{description}

\subsection{Ease of Integration}

The complexity and cost of integration of recommender systems into existing applications is a major constraint for many projects. Ease of integration is therefore a key requirement for this project.
