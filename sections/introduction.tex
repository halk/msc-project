\chapter{Introduction}

In this project I will develop an architecture for the integration of recommender systems.

Essentially, a \emph{recommender system} is software which suggests useful items to a user usually on a given website. A user is typically assisted in their search process on the website to find the right item. Recommender systems are able to personalise so that they try to suggest only items relevant for the given user. In order to do this recommender systems rely on multiple techniques, notably \emph{collaborative filtering} and \emph{content-based filtering}.

Recommender systems are usually tightly coupled to the context and architecture of the website. Bespoke recommender systems may be very dependent on the website's database structure as well as technical constraints such as programming languages. This project aims to develop and evaluate an ecosystem for various recommenders which hides the complexity from external systems and ultimately makes it easy to integrate. 

\section{Proposal Structure}

\begin{description}
    \item[Section 2] introduces the concept of recommender systems. An overview of recommender techniques as well as algorithms are described. Finally, adoption of recommender systems in research and enterprises as well as existing solutions are evaluated.
    \item[Section 3] discusses challenges of recommender system as well as requirements for the project. The aims and objectives of the project are explained.
    \item[Section 4] presents the architectural design of the solution and defines the technologies to be used. Finally, a project plan is laid out.
