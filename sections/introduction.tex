\chapter{Introduction}

In this project I will design and develop an architecture for the integration of recommender systems.

Essentially, a \emph{recommender system} is software which suggests useful items to a user on a given website or other platform. A user is typically assisted in their search process on the platform which might be so vast that it becomes difficult to find the right item. Recommender systems are able to personalise so that they try to suggest only items relevant for the particular user. In order to do this recommender systems rely on multiple techniques, notably \emph{collaborative filtering} and \emph{content-based filtering}.

Recommender systems are usually tightly coupled to the context and architecture of the beforementioned platform. Bespoke recommender systems may be dependent on web application's database structure as well as fit into implementation constraints such as programming languages. This project aims to deliver a \emph{multi-purpose recommender framework} which supports multiple techniques, is loosely coupled and easy to integrate. The framework provides an ecosystem with a plug-in system for recommender techniques and an event-driven learning concept. The solution of this project will be demonstrated in a real-life use case.

\section{Proposal Structure}

\begin{description}
    \item[Section 2] introduces the concept of recommender systems. An overview of recommender techniques as well as algorithms are described. Finally, adoption of recommender systems in research and enterprises as well as existing solutions are evaluated.
    \item[Section 3] discusses challenges of recommender system as well as requirements for the project. The aims and objectives of the project are explained.
    \item[Section 4] presents the architectural design of the solution and defines the technologies to be used. Finally, a project plan is laid out.
