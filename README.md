Supervised by Nigel Martin

## Build

1. Install MacTeX
2. Clone this repository and browse to the created directory in a terminal
3. Run `xelatex -shell-escape index.tex`
4. You may want to run this two or three times (so that e.g. table of content are loaded after the first compilation)
5. To re-compile bibliography, run `bibtex index.aux`. Repeat 3.
